.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B GNUjump
GNUjump is part of the GNU project.

GNUjump is a clone of the simple yet addictive game Xjump, adding new features
like multiplaying, unlimited FPS, smooth floor falling, themable graphics etc...

The goal in this game is to jump to the next floor so you don't fall down. As
you go upper in the Falling Tower the floors will fall faster. Try to survive
longer than anyone.

To make the multiplayer games last longer, you can choose to have more than one
live, but the final result will be divided by the number of lives consumed.
