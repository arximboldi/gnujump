GNUjump is a clone of the simple yet addictive game Xjump, adding new
features like multiplaying, unlimited FPS, smooth floor falling,
themable graphics, sounds, replays, ...

The goal in this game is to jump to the next floor trying not to fall
down. As you go upper in the Falling Tower the floors will fall
faster. Try to survive longer get upper than anyone. It might seem too
simple but once you've tried you'll realize how addictive this is.
